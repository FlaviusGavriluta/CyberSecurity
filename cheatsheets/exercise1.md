## Prerequisites
- `john` (John the Ripper) installed and runnable from the command line.  

###  Wordlist (produced from Mentalist):  

**Location (example):**  
`/Users/user/CyberSecurity/wordlists/misc/wordlist\ -\ mentalist.txt`

### Custom John rules (from Mentalist)

**Location (example):**  
`/Users/user/CyberSecurity/wordlists/misc/John rules.rules`

**File content (exact):**
```text
# Rules Generated by
# Mentalist
#
# Rule chain
# ---------------------
# Node 1: Case
# 	-Toggle: 2nd
# Node 2: Substitution
# 	-Replace All: s -> $ (One at a time)
#
# Total Rules: 1
T1ss$
```

---

## Assumption
The mutated wordlist was generated with **mentalist** and saved to a path you control.  
Copy the rules file into John config directory and rename/merge into john-local.conf.
Ensure the rule block in john-local.conf follows John syntax. If the Mentalist output is already valid John rule syntax (e.g. T1ss$) place it under a named ruleset:
```bash
[List.Rules:MENTALIST]
T1ss$
```
