# CyberSecurity Notes

This repository contains my personal CyberSecurity study notes, labs, and cheatsheets.  
It is organized to keep track of TryHackMe labs, useful commands, and reference material for tools like John the Ripper, Hashcat, Nmap, and others.

## Structure

- **labs/** – Notes from TryHackMe labs  
  Example: `labs/2025-11-04-room-name.md`

- **cheatsheets/** – Tool reference sheets  
  Example: `cheatsheets/john.md`, `cheatsheets/hashcat.md`

- **commands/** – Common Linux, Git, and terminal commands  
  Example: `commands/linux.md`, `commands/git.md`

- **anki/** – Files ready to import into Anki for spaced repetition  
  Example: `anki/ready_to_import.csv`

- **README.md** – This file, describing the repository

## Usage

- Read notes in `labs/` to review labs.  
- Check `cheatsheets/` for quick reference.  
- Use `commands/` for practical terminal commands.  
- Import `anki/ready_to_import.csv` into Anki to reinforce memory.
