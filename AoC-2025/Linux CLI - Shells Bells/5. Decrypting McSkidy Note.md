# 🥚 Easter Egg #3 — Decrypting McSkidy’s Note

After collecting all passcode fragments:

- `PASSFRAG1="3ast3r"`
- `PASSFRAG2="-1s-"`
- `PASSFRAG3="c0M1nG"`

The final passcode becomes:

```
3ast3r-1s-c0M1nG
```

## 🔍 Finding the encrypted file
Inside `/home/eddi_knapp/Documents/` we found the encrypted message:

```
mcskidy_note.txt.gpg
```

Initial attempts produced:

```
eddi_knapp@tbfc-web01:~/Documents$ gpg -d mcskidy_note.txt.gpg 
gpg: AES256.CFB encrypted data
gpg: encrypted with 1 passphrase
gpg: decryption failed: Bad session key
```

This happens because GPG agent sometimes blocks unlocking when not run as the correct user.

---

## 🔓 Successful decryption

Running as root with explicit passphrase:

```bash
mcskidy@tbfc-web01:~$ sudo su
root@tbfc-web01:/home/mcskidy$ cd /home/eddi_knapp/Documents/

gpg -d --batch --passphrase "3ast3r-1s-c0M1nG" mcskidy_note.txt.gpg > mcskidy_note.txt
```

This produced the decrypted file `mcskidy_note.txt`.

## 📄 Decrypted Message:


```
root@tbfc-web01:/home/eddi_knapp/Documents$ cat mcskidy_note.txt
Congrats — you found all fragments and reached this file.

Below is the list that should be live on the site. If you replace the contents of
/home/socmas/2025/wishlist.txt with this exact list (one item per line, no numbering),
the site will recognise it and the takeover glitching will stop. Do it — it will save the site.

Hardware security keys (YubiKey or similar)
Commercial password manager subscriptions (team seats)
Endpoint detection & response (EDR) licenses
Secure remote access appliances (jump boxes)
Cloud workload scanning credits (container/image scanning)
Threat intelligence feed subscription

Secure code review / SAST tool access
Dedicated secure test lab VM pool
Incident response runbook templates and playbooks
Electronic safe drive with encrypted backups

A final note — I don't know exactly where they have me, but there are *lots* of eggs
and I can smell chocolate in the air. Something big is coming.  — McSkidy

When the wishlist is corrected, the site will show a block of ciphertext. This ciphertext can be decrypted with the following unlock key:

UNLOCK_KEY: 91J6X7R4FQ9TQPM9JX2Q9X2Z

To decode the ciphertext, use OpenSSL. For instance, if you copied the ciphertext into a file /tmp/website_output.txt you could decode using the following command:

cat > /tmp/website_output.txt
openssl enc -d -aes-256-cbc -pbkdf2 -iter 200000 -salt -base64 -in /tmp/website_output.txt -out /tmp/decoded_message.txt -pass pass:'91J6X7R4FQ9TQPM9JX2Q9X2Z'
cat /tmp/decoded_message.txt

Sorry to be so convoluted, I couldn't risk making this easy while King Malhare watches. — McSkidy

## 📄 Decrypted Message Summary

McSkidy reveals that the correct **wishlist** must be placed at:

```
/home/socmas/2025/wishlist.txt
```

The list must contain:

- Hardware security keys (YubiKey or similar)  
- Commercial password manager subscriptions (team seats)  
- Endpoint detection & response (EDR) licenses  
- Secure remote access appliances (jump boxes)  
- Cloud workload scanning credits (container/image scanning)  
- Threat intelligence feed subscription  
- Secure code review / SAST tool access  
- Dedicated secure test lab VM pool  
- Incident response runbook templates and playbooks  
- Electronic safe drive with encrypted backups  

Once the wishlist is fixed, the site will output ciphertext.  
This ciphertext is decrypted using the unlock key:

```
UNLOCK_KEY: 91J6X7R4FQ9TQPM9JX2Q9X2Z
```

Example OpenSSL command:

```bash
openssl enc -d -aes-256-cbc -pbkdf2 -iter 200000 -salt -base64 \
  -in /tmp/website_output.txt \
  -out /tmp/decoded_message.txt \
  -pass pass:'91J6X7R4FQ9TQPM9JX2Q9X2Z'
```
