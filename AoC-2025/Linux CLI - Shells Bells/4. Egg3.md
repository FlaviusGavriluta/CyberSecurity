# 🥚 Easter Egg #3

**Clue:**  
"When pixels sleep, their tails sometimes whisper plain words.  
Listen to the tail."

**Interpretation:**  
- Refers to hidden content in image files or metadata ("pixels" = images, "tails" = file endings or metadata).  
- In this task, the clue was stored in a hidden file `.easter_egg` inside the `Pictures` directory.

**Location:** `/home/eddi_knapp/Pictures/`

**Steps taken:**
1. Navigated to the Pictures directory:
   ```bash
   cd ~/Pictures
   ls -la
   ```
2. Found the hidden file `.easter_egg`.
3. Viewed the file contents:
   ```bash
   cat .easter_egg
   ```
4. Retrieved the third passcode fragment:
   ```text
   PASSFRAG3: c0M1nG
   ```

**Notes:**
- This is the final fragment needed to unlock McSkidy’s hidden vault.
- Keep fragments in order:
  1. `PASSFRAG1="3ast3r"`
  2. `PASSFRAG2="-1s-"`
  3. `PASSFRAG3="c0M1nG"`
