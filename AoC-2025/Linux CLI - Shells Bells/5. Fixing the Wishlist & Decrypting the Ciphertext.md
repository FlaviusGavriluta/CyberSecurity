# 🧩 Step 4 — Fixing the Wishlist & Decrypting the Ciphertext

### ✔ Task Summary
After gathering the three password fragments (`3ast3r-1s-c0M1nG`) and decrypting `mcskidy_note.txt.gpg`, the message revealed that I needed to:

1. Replace the contents of  
   `/home/socmas/2025/wishlist.txt`  
   with the exact list provided in the decrypted note.
2. Doing this correctly triggers the website to display a block of ciphertext.
3. That ciphertext must be decrypted using the provided **UNLOCK_KEY**.

## 🔧 Correcting the Wishlist
I replaced the entire content of `/home/socmas/2025/wishlist.txt` with:

```
Hardware security keys (YubiKey or similar)
Commercial password manager subscriptions (team seats)
Endpoint detection & response (EDR) licenses
Secure remote access appliances (jump boxes)
Cloud workload scanning credits (container/image scanning)
Threat intelligence feed subscription

Secure code review / SAST tool access
Dedicated secure test lab VM pool
Incident response runbook templates and playbooks
Electronic safe drive with encrypted backups
```

Once updated, the site displayed the ciphertext.

## 🔓 Decryption Command Used

```
openssl enc -d -aes-256-cbc -pbkdf2 -iter 200000 -salt -base64 \
-in /tmp/website_output.txt -out /tmp/decoded_message.txt \
-pass pass:'91J6X7R4FQ9TQPM9JX2Q9X2Z'
```

## 📜 Decrypted Message (Result)

```
Well done — the glitch is fixed. Amazing job going the extra mile and saving the site.
Take this flag THM{w3lcome_2_A0c_2025}

NEXT STEP:
If you fancy something a little...spicier....use the FLAG you just obtained as the passphrase to unlock:
/home/eddi_knapp/.secret/dir

That hidden directory has been archived and encrypted with the FLAG.
Inside it you'll find the sidequest key.
```

## 📌 Notes
- Successfully decrypted the ciphertext and obtained the **FLAG**:  
  `THM{w3lcome_2_A0c_2025}`
- Next objective: use this FLAG as a passphrase to unlock the hidden directory:  
  `/home/eddi_knapp/.secret/dir`
