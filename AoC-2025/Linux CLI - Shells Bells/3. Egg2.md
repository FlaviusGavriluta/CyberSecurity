# 🥚 Easter Egg #2

**Clue:**  
“The tree shows today; the rings remember yesterday.  
Read the ledger’s older pages.”

**Interpretation:**  
- Refers to the history of the project — Git logs and commits.  
- We need to explore the `.git` directory to find the hidden fragment.

**Location:** `/home/eddi_knapp/.secret_git/`

**Steps taken:**
1. Switched to the `eddi_knapp` user:
   ```bash
   su eddi_knapp
   ```
2. Navigated to the secret Git repository:
   ```bash
   cd /home/eddi_knapp/.secret_git
   ```
3. Checked branch and commit history:
   ```bash
   git branch
   git log
   git show d12875c8b62e089320880b9b7e41d6765818af3d
   ```
4. Found the second passcode fragment in the commit:
   ```text
   PASSFRAG2: -1s-
   ```

**Notes:**
- This is the second fragment of the three required to unlock McSkidy’s hidden vault.
- Keep fragments in order as instructed in `read-me-please.txt`.
