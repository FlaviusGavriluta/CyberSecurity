# 🥚 Easter Egg #1

**“I ride with your session, not with your chest of files.
Open the little bag your shell carries when you arrive.”**

These include files such as .bash_history, .bashrc, and .profile, all related to shell sessions.

Most likely, the clue refers to checking files such as:

```bash
ls -la ~
cat ~/.bash_history
cat ~/.bashrc
cat ~/.profile
```

**Location:** `/home/eddi_knapp/`  

**Steps taken:**
1. Navigated to `/home/eddi_knapp/`
2. Listed hidden files and directories:
   ```bash
   ls -la
   ```
3. Explored `.bashrc` and `.bash_logout` files for clues.
4. Found the environment variable revealing the first passcode fragment:
   ```bash
   export PASSFRAG1="3ast3r"
   ```

**Notes:**
- This is the first fragment of the three required to unlock McSkidy’s hidden vault.
- Keep fragments in order as instructed in `read-me-please.txt`.
